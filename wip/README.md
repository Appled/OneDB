# Welcome to the Work In Progress section
These files are not required or approved by AscEmu. C'mon, join the party and give us some feedback to the unfinished work.

## How to use WIP-Files?
AscEmu allowes you to load seperated data into the official tables. This feature can be found in the world.conf (LoadAdditionalTables).
